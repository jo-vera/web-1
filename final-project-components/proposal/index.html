          My project’s topic is Egg Theory which is one of many beliefs based in
          the afterlife and explanation of human existence. The egg theory has a
          large following of believers; it originated in 2009 from a short story
          by Andy Weir titled, “The Egg.” The story guides you through a tragic
          death from a car accident where “you” reach the afterlife and are
          greeted by “God.” This God welcomes you while you worry about the
          family you left behind, the God reassures you that everything will be
          ok until you ask, “what happens next?” The God explains that you will
          be reincarnated and wake up as a baby and the cycle will continue
          again and again, you are every good and bad person that has ever
          existed. This specific theory discusses that every human to ever exist
          is just you, a single being reincarnated over and over again. There
          has only been one person to experience this world just unknowingly,
          interacting with themselves in different forms. For a long time there
          will just be new versions of yourself until you have experienced every
          experience possible, every happy or sad moment, after you experienced
          everything you will finally end the cycle of constant reincarnation
          and become the most ultimate version of yourself. The theory debates
          that you are every single person on the earth, you are over 9 billion
          people and 9 billion people are all you, you are every person that has
          been and will continue to be. At the end of the cycle you will
          eventually become just like the God of the story, a guidance to the
          next Egg. This theory interests me because there is a certain comfort
          it brings people, from discourse online it gives people a sense of
          purpose as well as a more clear ending once they die. I’m not sure if
          I actually believe in this theory, it’s scary to think that there
          isn’t another person in this world other than myself. My plan for this
          project is to start as an explanation page from an unbiased pop
          website like teen vogue or buzzfeed, some place unserious but still a
          place that presents the information in a readable manner. If the user
          goes to the bottom of the page they’ll encounter a viewer comment with
          a link to a special website. This special website will be a blog with
          multiple entries of a user who has managed to write about their
          multiple reincarnations. This blog is meant to be eerie, it gives
          hints that the cycle is coming to an end and soon a person will die
          marking that every experience has been completed and we, us, you are
          becoming a God. I wanted to create a connection between Andy Weir and
          animator Kurzgesagt who brought this theory to popular media today, a
          slow realization that we are becoming aware of this reality. Many
          games have used this template of slow awakening to a horrific event
          that they were blind to and I think it would be really interesting to
          do in website, blog, and entry form. I think most of our projects can
          become benevolent lies, many conspiracy theories are used to comfort
          people that their beliefs are fact and not just speculation. This
          theory is no different, the same way people believe in an afterlife is
          the same way people believe in reincarnation. My goal is to lean into
          the theory as truth and that a ‘me’ in another body is awakening to
          the egg theory. The egg theory is true to whoever it resonates with
          and people will hold it true forever.
