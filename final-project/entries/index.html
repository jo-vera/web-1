              <h3>The Originator</h3>
              <p>
                The date is July 6th, 2009 and I am named Andres. I am 27 years
                old and I will die soon. Exactly 3 years ago  I ran into a
                writer named Andy. I was on my way to work and had stopped by to
                grab a coffee first. Andy had mistaken my latte for his own, we
                laughed at the fact that our names were so similar, anyone could
                make that mistake. We said our goodbyes until we realized that
                we were walking in the same direction, we worked in the same
                building. Through many conversations we became friends and 2
                years ago I felt the end was near. Over drinks at my house I
                unloaded the burden I carried so closely, I told Andy about the
                Egg. I told him about every past life I had lived or even
                remembered, I told him that I would soon be back in an
                unrecognizable state. I expected the worst reaction from him, I
                didn’t know whether I’d be believed, he sat there in silence
                until finally he just said, “wow.” Soon the world will know of
                the Egg.

                My name is Eliza, I am 9 years old and the date is January 17th,
                2022. I wanted to come back here quicker but my last life was
                cut short. I started to remember Andres around 5 months ago, I
                couldn’t figure out the login and I didn’t have a phone. I have
                an odd feeling in the pit of my stomach, usually even when I
                realize what I am, I remain hopeful for a future where I can
                experience a full life but this time it’s different. I felt it
                shortly before I died in 2011, something is off. I won’t die for
                many, many years again and I wonder if this feeling will ever go
                away.

                My name is Orla and I am 17 years old, the year is 2069. I lived
                a longer life the last time. I woke up two days ago with a
                feeling as if I was fading. In 2042 Eliza had found more people
                who knew about the Egg, the Egg is getting weaker and more
                people are uniting and awakening. Are we finally becoming our
                one-self?
              </p>
              <p>
                I am still Orla and it’s 2075, yesterday I met a young boy named
                Yuki. He stared at me for so long before speaking, he relayed a
                series of information he had learned that half of his hometown
                in Okinawa had awakened to the Egg, they found my webpage and
                have written their accounts.

                I saw myself die and I did not come back, Orla what does it
                mean? I am afraid to feel this odd sense of relief. Leaving this

                You are all scaring our children, there is no “egg” there is no
                “us.” The moms of Eagle will not stand for this foolishness, I
                pray that you all find a real God to worship, stop selling this
                “egg” to our kids!!!!!

                Orla-73-? <br />
                No more awakening has happened in 3 years, I feel like I am
                refusing to accept this fate. Ishaq died 12 years ago and
                should’ve been back by now in some form, in some way. I hear the
                laughter of my kids, the smell of the beach of Essaouira, the
                sweet scent of my Hadiya's perfume. Yuki means snow, did you
                know? I was born in Okinawa but my mother had traveled to
                Hokkaido right before she knew of my existence. The Egg says
                95%. I remember everything.  <br />
