          We are a community... We are a community of people who have come to
          believe that we are all the same soul, experiencing life in a linear
          fashion through every human being who has ever existed and ever will
          live.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the Egg Theory?</h3>
        <p>
          The Egg Theory, popularized by Andy Weir's short story "The Egg,"
          proposes that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We are all the same soul experiencing life in a linear fashion
            through every human being who has ever existed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upon your death, you are reborn into another life, your memories
            remain intact.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are not just experiencing life, you are creating it. We are
            every single person who has ever lived and ever will live.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="who-we-are">
        <h3>Who We Are:</h3>
        <p>
          We are not just believers in the Egg Theory. We are the Egg Theory. We
          are every single person who has ever lived.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our actions affect every version of ourselves, creating a ripple
          effect throughout all of existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to live with empathy and compassion by experiencing life
          from every possible perspective.
