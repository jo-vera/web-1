            <h1>Author's View: How Graphic Design Is Evolving</h1>
          </header>
          Technology has drastically changed in graphic design. Graphic Design
          has moving it beyond just product packaging to online content creation
          for marketing and customer interaction. Companies are now using data
          and analytics to see what designs are most effective. This shift has
          led to a rise in content marketing and the importance of graphic
          design in digital strategies. The tools available have also evolved
          which allows designers to work remotely and companies to hire
          freelancers globally. This has opened up the field and made it more
          accessible for junior designers.

          I appreciated the outlook of this article, this article was written in
          2017 and much has changed since. I wonder if the author could have
          imagined how fast AI and other technologies evolved, did they think it
          would take much longer than 7 years? I do believe that graphic design
          still holds power in the marketing field, people seem to appreciate
          the art behind campaigns. There are many new paths for graphic
          designers and many people have found new paths to take.With the
          evolution of design tools, I wonder how much graphic design will
          change in another 7 years.
