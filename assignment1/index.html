        <p>I really enjoyed reading through this article. Particularly I enjoyed Wagner's vivid descriptions of the aesthetics of the older websites. Older designs for websites have now become very nostalgic to the late 90s and early 2000s which contrasts greatly to modern design that focuses on a more minimalist aesthetic. During the earlier days of the Internet, Wagner recalls a cluttered webpage space, littered with gifs, bulky typography, and grainy/blurry images. This aesthetic has shifted greatly with the evolution of design that favors a more sleek aesthetic, one that encouraged a more sophisticated way of web design.</p>

        <p>Reading about Wagner’s first experiences with the World Wide Web also brought me back to my own memories. I noted her reaction to how information was found most interesting. In this article she states, "The Geocities page was a testament to the creativity and ingenuity of the early internet, but it was also a reminder of how important search engines were in connecting people with the information they needed." It’s hard to recall exactly what search engine I was first introduced, but I do remember the amusement I experienced when a simple question could be answered so quickly.  Wagner also notes that although search engines throughout the internet’s history are invaluable, they have also come a long way. </p>
        
        <p>Wagner remembers a time where she would ask a question and receive an odd answer or an  answer that hardly related to the initial question. During her research for a school project she goes on to the web, she states, "I typed ‘railroad crossings’ into the search bar, and AltaVista returned a dizzying array of results. Most of them were irrelevant, but one link stood out: a Geocities page dedicated to the history of railroad crossings in the United States." This shows how challenging it could be in earlier days to get information that was needed or even information that was accurate. Upon reading this I wrote down a few reflection on how this experience relates to present day. The evolution of this initial problem is the debate  about the quality and accuracy of search engine results as people worry about misinformation spread through the web as well as fake news. </p>

        <p>One section that I really enjoyed was, “Facebook vs. Tweens (and Russian Grandmothers).” I specifically enjoyed the conversation of the striping of creativity with personal pages like MySpace and Facebook. With the progression of the internet and design, places like MySpace were seen as ugly when previously it was seen as fun and very personal to the user. With one glance at a person’s MySpace page you could understand exactly what person liked and how they presented themselves to the world. However, this fascination didn’t last too long as pages like Facebook rose to popularity. MySpace was no longer seen as cool but rather ugly and Facebook’s simplicity was now in power. Wagner states, "The assumption that the attributes of Myspace were the sole domain of the tween doesn’t fit at all with the truth; many former users still care about these glittery sites because they were able to make them truly their own." Although the sleekness of Facebook was enjoyed, there was something lost in the lack of personalization. This rings true as more users, especially when looking at phones UI, call for more personalization that allows them to show who they are through their screens.</p>

        <p>Lastly, Kate Wagner's "404 Page Not Found" is a huge reminder of the rapid evolution of the internet and the profound impact it has had on our lives. By reflecting on our past experiences, we can gain a better understanding of the present and shape a more positive future for the digital age.</p>
